    "1. **File**: This menu has options to create a new notebook, open an existing one, save the current notebook, make a copy of it, rename it, and download it in various formats including .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook), .py (Python), .html, .pdf, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edit**: This menu provides options for cut/copy/paste cells, delete cells, split and merge cells, move cells up or down, find and replace within the notebook, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **View**: This menu allows you to toggle the visibility of the header and toolbar, and the cell number and output.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Insert**: This menu has options to insert a new cell above or below the current cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Cell**: This menu provides cell operations like run, interrupt, and stop. It also has options to change the cell type and clear the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Kernel**: This menu allows you to connect to a different kernel (i.e., Python 2, Python 3, R, etc.), restart the kernel, reconnect to the kernel, shutdown the kernel, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "The kernel in a Jupyter notebook is like the **brain** of an animal. Just as the brain processes information, makes decisions, and controls functions in an animal, the kernel executes the code, processes the data, and renders the output in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to compare it to a specific animal, consider the kernel as the **octopus's brain**. An octopus is known for its intelligence and problem-solving abilities. Similarly, the kernel can handle complex computations and manage multiple tasks efficiently. Also, just as an octopus uses its arms to interact with its environment, the kernel communicates with the notebook interface and performs operations based on the user's input.\n",

    "* **Markdown Cells**: These cells contain text formatted using markdown and are used to document the computational process in a literate way.\n",

    "* **Raw Cells**: These cells are not evaluated by the notebook. Raw cells could potentially be used to write output directly.\n",

For example, if you want to change a cell to Markdown, you would select \"Markdown\" from the dropdown menu. If you want to change a cell to code, you would select \"Code\". \n",
